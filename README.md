## About project

This repository contains my practice in new things while learning Unity.
<br>When I'm learning something new that's not big enough for a standalone project, I first read the documentation, then watch the video tutorials, and finally practice here.

This project has helped me understand many things that used to seem like a dark forest to me ;p
